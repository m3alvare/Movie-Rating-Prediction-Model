In today's movie industry, the success of a movie is dependent on a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict. Movie producers invest significant amounts of money in a project with the hope of generating a profit in the end. However, movie production is a high-risk industry where there are no guarantees that a movie will be a hit, and investors can lose a substantial amount of money. This makes the need for predicting movie performance all the more important. 

The goal of this project is to utilize supervised machine learning methods to predict a movie's IMDb rating and then provide insight to production companies. This model will be based on a movieâ€™s genre, actors, directors, writers, and other data retrieved from IMDb's dataset of movies. This predictive tool has the potential to be a powerful asset for movie producers to make more informed decisions and project the potential success of a movie.
